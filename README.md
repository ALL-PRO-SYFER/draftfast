Special thanks to _swanson, who authored [this repo](https://github.com/swanson/degenerate), which mine is heavily based off of. I currently use data from [Fantasy Pros](http://www.fantasypros.com/) as the criteria to optimize on.

Pre-reqs:

* [ortools](https://developers.google.com/optimization/installing?hl=en)

To run, pass in the current week to the script:
<pre><code>python optimize.py 1</pre></code>

To do:

* More data
* Use weekly and not yearly projections
* Find better way of combining data sets on name
